","Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by a proprietary anaerobic fermentation method in which ​​the coffee fruit is first sterilized, then fermented anaerobically in the whole fruit with added microorganisms for 36 hours. After this fermentation in the whole fruit, the coffee is subjected to thermal shock (first a high temperature to swell the beans and allow the unique flavors and aromas from the initial anaerobic yeast fermentation to penetrate the seeds, then a cold temperature to constrict the beans and lock in those flavors and aromas). Finally, the whole cherries are carefully dried by machine until the beans reach 10.5% internal humidity.
